* Build a runtime for lists
 - Create the object type
   - Append: O(1)
   - Modify: O(n)
   - Delete: O(n)
 - Create native interface functions (indexes are 0 based)
   - append(list, object) -> nil
     - Appends an element to the list
   - delete(list, index) -> object
     - Deletes an element from the list, and returns it
     - Raises a runtime error if the index does not exist
   - len(list) -> integer
     - Returns the length of the list
   - slice(list, start, stop, step) -> list
     - Returns a new list object containing references referencing the
       objects in the original one, from index start, not including
       index stop. Step shall be an integer larger than 0
* Create specific syntax for lists
