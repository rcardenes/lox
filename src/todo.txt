List semantics and other stuff taken from:
  https://calebschoepp.com/blog/2020/adding-a-list-data-type-to-lox

Challenges (from Caleb's site):
    * Make append and delete syntactic statements
      - Alternatively, make them methods of the list type
    * Shrink the list if it deallocates enough memory

Challenges (own):
    * Measure the efficiency of list initialization. See how it can be improved
    * Add slicing syntax for list/sequences
