List semantics and other stuff taken from:
  https://calebschoepp.com/blog/2020/adding-a-list-data-type-to-lox

Challenges (from Caleb's site):
    * Maybe make append/delete methods of the list type
      - This would need maybe some kind of "native classes"

Challenges (own):
    * Measure the efficiency of list initialization. See how it can be improved
    * Add slicing syntax for list/sequences
    * Implement a register-based VM, and compare performances
